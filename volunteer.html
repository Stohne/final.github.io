<h3>Volunteering</h3>

  <h4>PAWS Ohio has rescued, fostered, treated and adopted thousands of animals through an amazing network of dedicated volunteers who perform a variety of tasks that help save the lives of dogs and cats in need. Volunteers are critical to our success, and they perform many vital functions at PAWS. We could not do what we do without all of our dedicated volunteers!</h4>
