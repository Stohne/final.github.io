<h3>What is PAWS?</h3>

<h4>The Public Animal Welfare Society, Inc. (PAWS) was founded in 1976. We are a 501(3)(c) non-profit, no-kill organization considered to be one of Ohio’s most reputable long-standing cat and dog humane rescue groups. Our mission is to rescue, foster, and adopt companion animals in Northeastern Ohio<h4>

<hr />

  <p>Additionally, we provide medical treatment for injured or sick animals we take in as well as spaying and neutering services. We are also deeply involved in Animal Welfare Legislation and our Executive Director, Amy Beichler, was the driving force behind the passage of Goddard's Law in 2016 which made it a felony to abuse companion animals in Ohio.
<br />
<br />
We are a volunteer based organization governed by a Board of Volunteer Directors.  PAWS is managed by an Executive Director and an Associate Director who control the day-to-day operations. Under the Executive Director, we have volunteer coordinators that manage a number of specific departments within PAWS, as well as a host of dedicated volunteers who give their time and efforts to PAWS-related tasks and events.</p>
